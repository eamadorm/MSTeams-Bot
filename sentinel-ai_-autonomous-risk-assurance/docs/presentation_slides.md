# Sentinel AI: The Future of Autonomous Risk Assurance

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** Sentinel AI: Autonomous Risk Assurance
**Subtitle:** Moving from "Sample-Based Manual Auditing" to "Continuous Autonomous Verification"
**Presenter:** [Your Name/Organization]

## Slide 2: The "Audit Trilemma"

**Headline:** The Internal Audit Status Quo is Broken

*   **Manual & Slow:** 
    *   Audits take weeks to plan, execute, and report. 
    *   High labor cost (human hours spent on checklists).
*   **Sample-Based:**
    *   Testing only 25-50 samples out of millions of transactions.
    *   99% of population remains unverified (Risk Blindness).
*   **Retroactive:**
    *   "Looking in the rear-view mirror."
    *   Issues detected 90 days after they occur.

**Speaker Note:** "We are still auditing digital companies with analog methods. We manually pull samples, verify them on spreadsheets, and report months later. This leaves a massive coverage gap."

## Slide 3: The Sentinel Solution

**Headline:** Enter Autonomous Assurance

**Concept:**
Deploy specialized AI Agents that act as "Always-On Auditors".

*   **Agent 1:** The Identity Assurer (Verifies access, SoD, Orphans)
*   **Agent 2:** The Forensic Accountant (Verifies transactions, fraud patterns)
*   **Agent 3:** The Compliance Custodian (Verifies logs, evidence, chains of custody)

**Value Prop:**
*   From **5% Sampling** → **100% Population Coverage**
*   From **Quarterly Checks** → **Real-Time Detection**
*   From **Manual Spreadsheets** → **Autonomous Execution**

## Slide 4: Core Capabilities

**Headline:** How It Works

1.  **Direct Integration:**
    *   Connects directly to source systems (Okta, Splunk, BigQuery, Google Cloud).
    *   No manual data dumps required.

2.  **Cognitive Reasoning (Gemini Enterprise):**
    *   Understanding context: "Is this access request valid given the user's role?"
    *   Statistical Forensics: Applying Benford's Law and Z-Scores to financial data.

3.  **Immutable Reporting:**
    *   Every finding is cryptographically hashed.
    *   Chain-of-custody is preserved for external regulators (SOX/ISO).

## Slide 5: The Architecture

**Headline:** Built on Generative AI & Tool Use

*   **The Brain:** Google Gemini Enterprise 1.5 Pro (Reasoning & Context).
*   **The Hands:** Function Calling / Tools (SQL, API, Graph Query).
*   **The Interface:** Sentinel Dashboard (Real-time command center).

**Process Flow:**
1.  **Trigger:** Scheduled or Risk-Event driven.
2.  **Plan:** Agent decomposes the audit program into technical steps.
3.  **Act:** Agent queries live systems (read-only).
4.  **Reason:** Agent analyzes findings against policy.
5.  **Report:** Agent generates signed deficiency memo.

## Slide 6: Business Impact

**Headline:** ROI & Strategic Value

*   **Cost Reduction:** Reduce external audit fees and internal labor hours by 40-60%.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Catch "Toxic Combinations" and Fraud before they materialize into losses.
*   **Regulatory Confidence:** Prove to regulators that you have continuous monitoring, not just point-in-time checks.

## Slide 7: Demo Roadmap

**Headline:** What You Will See Today

1.  **Command Center:** Situational awareness of the control environment.
2.  **Live Deployment:** Launching an "IAM Assurance Agent" to find Toxic Combinations.
3.  **Forensic Execution:** Watching the agent reason and query in real-time.
4.  **Instant Reporting:** Generating a signed audit memorandum in seconds.

## Slide 8: Closing

**Headline:** The Future is Autonomous

"Sentinel AI doesn't replace the auditor; it elevates them. It handles the verification of the millions, so humans can focus on the strategic few."
