**Target Audience:** CFOs, CISOs, Audit Committee Chairs
**Goal:** Demonstrate how **Autonomous Agents** revolutionize Risk Compliance & Assessment.

## 1. The Hook: The Capacity Problem
**Visual:** App loads. **Welcome Modal** is visible (Do not close it yet).

**[Action]**
*   Gesturing to the "Sentinel AI" shield icon.

**[Voice Track]**
"Good morning. The fundamental problem in Risk and Compliance today is **capacity**.
We have thousands of controls, millions of transactions, and diverse systems like Cloud, HR, and Finance.
But we only have a handful of human auditors.

This leads to the 'Audit Gap': We rely on sampling 1% of the data once a year, leaving 99% of the risk unassessed.
**Sentinel AI** solves this by deploying a fleet of **Autonomous AI Agents**. These aren't just scripts; they are specialized 'digital auditors' that work 24/7 to assess 100% of your environment."

**[Action]**
*   Click the large blue button: **"Launch Live Simulation"**.

---

## 2. The Command Center: Managing the Fleet
**Visual:** The **Risk Dashboard** fades in.

**[Action]**
1.  Hover over the top metrics (Control Coverage, Active Agents).
2.  Click **"Analytics & Trends"** in the sidebar.

**[Voice Track]**
"Welcome to the Command Center.
This is where we manage our agent workforce.
Unlike a static dashboard, this shows **Live Assessment Velocity**.
We can see exactly which agents are currently deployed—whether they are assessing Financial Controls, IT Security, or Regulatory Compliance. We are moving from 'Retroactive Reporting' to 'Continuous Assessment'."

**[Action]**
*   Click **"Command Center"** in the sidebar to return to the main view.

## 3. The Solution: Specialized Agents for Specific Risks
**Visual:** The User asks, *"How do we handle complex, specific risks?"*

**[Action]**
1.  Click **"Agent Portfolio"** in the sidebar.
2.  Hover over the different agent cards (IAM, Evidence, Anomaly).

**[Voice Track]**
"In the old world, you'd have to hire a specific consultant for each domain.
In Sentinel, we have **Specialized Agents** ready to deploy.

*   **The IAM Agent:** Specializes in Identity. It understands 'Toxic Access' and 'Segregation of Duties'.
*   **The Forensic Agent:** Specializes in Finance. It knows statistical laws like Benford's Law to find fraud.
*   **The Compliance Agent:** Specializes in Evidence. It gathers and hashes logs for SOX and ISO audits.

We simply assign the right Agent to the right Risk."

## 4. Trust & Governance: The "Glass Box"
**Visual:** Still in **Agent Portfolio**.

**[Action]**
1.  Pause on the **"Access Control Effectiveness"** card.
2.  Click **"View Agent Logic & Blueprint"**.

**[Voice Track]**
"Now, a critical question for compliance: 'How does the Agent decide?'
We operate as a **Glass Box**.
Here you see the Agent's **Blueprint**.
*   **The Logic:** We define exactly what systems it touches (Okta, Workday).
*   **The Reasoning:** We can see the specific steps it takes to assess the risk.
This allows your external auditors to validate the *methodology* of the Agent, giving you full defensibility."

**[Action]**
*   Click **"Close"** or **"Deploy Agent"** to return/go to Ops.

## 5. The Assessment: Autonomous Reasoning
**Visual:** Return to **Command Center**. Select the first risk: **"Toxic Access Combinations"**.

**[Action]**
1.  Point to the integration icons on the control card (Okta, Workday).
2.  Click the blue **"Deploy Agent"** button.

**[Voice Track]**
"Let's watch an **IAM Agent** perform a live assessment for 'Toxic Access'—the risk that someone can both create and pay a fake vendor.
I've deployed the agent.

**(Point to the Activity Visualizer - Left)**
On the left, the Agent is autonomously navigating our infrastructure. It's connecting to HR to see who is active, and Security to see who has admin rights.

**(Point to the Terminal - Right)**
On the right, you see the **Agent's Reasoning**.
It's not just matching keywords. It's asking: *'Does J.Doe have conflicting roles?'*
It found a conflict. It's now checking if there was a valid ticket approving that conflict.
This is the kind of complex cross-referencing that usually takes a human days."

---

## 6. The Outcome: Certified Compliance
**Visual:** The terminal stops. Status shows "Deficiency" or "Effective".

**[Action]**
*   Click **"View Report"** (The link appears after audit completes).

**[Voice Track]**
"The Agent has finished the assessment.
In 30 seconds, it performed a comprehensive audit of the entire user population.

**(Scroll to the bottom - 'Detailed Execution Audit Trail')**
It generated this **Internal Audit Memo**.
Critically, look at the **Audit Trail**. The Agent has cryptographically signed its work.
This serves as immutable proof of compliance. You can hand this directly to your regulators."
